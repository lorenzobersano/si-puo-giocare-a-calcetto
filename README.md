# SiPu√≤GiocareACalcetto?

WepApp created to try better the skills learned in React and NodeJS course.

## What does it do?

Tells if it's possible to play five-a-side football in the next seven days.

## How is this made?

I used React.js and styled-components on the frontend and NodeJS and Express on the backend.
The frontend simply shows the result of a REST API request to the backend which makes itself a REST API request to the DarkSky API to check the weather in the location where the user is.
